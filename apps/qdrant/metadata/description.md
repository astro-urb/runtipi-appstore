# Qdrant Vector Database

Qdrant is a high-performance vector similarity search engine designed for the next generation of AI applications. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage vector embeddings with additional payload.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for large-scale similarity search with billions of vectors
- **Rich Filtering**: Advanced filtering capabilities with payload metadata
- **Production Ready**: Built for real-world applications with clustering support
- **Multiple Distance Metrics**: Supports Cosine, Euclidean, and Dot Product similarities
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic CRUD operations without downtime
- **Cloud-Native**: Horizontal scaling with distributed deployment options

## Use Cases

- **Semantic Search**: Build powerful search engines that understand context
- **Recommendation Systems**: Create personalized recommendations based on similarity
- **RAG Applications**: Power Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems
- **Image Similarity**: Find similar images based on embeddings
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify outliers in high-dimensional data
- **Question Answering**: Build Q&A systems with semantic understanding

## Getting Started

After installation, Qdrant will be available at your configured port (default: 6333).

### Web Interface
Access the built-in web UI at `http://your-server:6333/dashboard` to:
- Monitor collections and points
- Run queries and explore data
- View system metrics

### API Access
Connect to Qdrant using any compatible client:

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

client = QdrantClient(
    url="http://your-server:6333",
    api_key="your-api-key"  # if authentication is enabled
)
```

### Creating Collections

```python
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="my_collection",
    vectors_config=VectorParams(size=384, distance=Distance.COSINE)
)
```

## Storage Configuration

Qdrant stores all data in the configured data directory:
- `/storage` - Vector data and indexes
- `/snapshots` - Backup snapshots

## Performance Tips

- Use appropriate shard and replica settings for large datasets
- Enable mmap for better memory efficiency on large collections
- Configure proper resource limits based on your workload
- Use batch operations for bulk inserts

## Security

- Enable API key authentication for production deployments
- Use HTTPS proxy for encrypted connections
- Restrict network access to trusted sources
- Regular backups using the snapshot feature

## Integration

Qdrant integrates seamlessly with:
- **LangChain** - For building LLM applications
- **LlamaIndex** - For document indexing and retrieval
- **OpenAI** - For generating embeddings
- **Hugging Face** - For transformer models
- **FastAPI** - For building APIs
